<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>If I see another Gloink anytime soon, there will be violence.</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> strolls into the common area. The gang is already present, and all look exhausted from yesterday's adventure.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-zooble"><b>Zooble: </b>For once, I agree with Jax. What was it, the fourth time we had a Gloinks adventure since Pomni came in? It's getting <del>FUCKING</del> old.</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="zooble">Zooble</span> rolls their eyes.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>I really don't know why Caine likes to reuse that particular set of NPCs so much.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-gangle"><b>Gangle: </b>Maybe he's&hellip; out of inspiration?</li>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>All I know is that the Queen is the most annoying piece of <del>SHIT</del> I've ever heard.</li>
<p class="tadc-dialog-ragatha"><b>Ragatha: </b>Well&hellip; for what it's worth, all things considered, she's a pretty decent mother.</li>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> snorts.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Oh, here we go again. Rags, just &lsquo;cause you have mommy issues doesn't make every mother you meet a good mom.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="ragatha">Ragatha</span>&rsquo;s eye widens.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-ragatha"><b>Ragatha: </b>Jax!</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> sighs, rubbing her temples.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>Ragatha does have a point, though. The Gloink Queen, for all her&hellip; <em>flaws</em>, is somewhat of a good mother to her spawn. I wouldn't be able to remember all those names.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>You'd make a terrible mom, Pompom.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>Huh? Why would you-</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="caine">Caine</span> interrupts.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>GREAT IDEA JAX! We should have an adventure about you being parents!</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>What-</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">SNAP!</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">A cloud of multicoloured confetti quickly dissipates around <span class="jax">Jax</span>. The gang stares at him, wide-eyed. When he looks down, he realizes he's holding something wrapped in a pastel blue blanket.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">It's&hellip; a child. A lavender rabbitoid.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Caine&hellip; what the <del>FUCK</del> is this?</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> slowly reaches for the newborn.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>Aww, she's actually pretty cute.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> stares at the creature. He lines up a punt, but stops, stares deeper.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">It's asleep. It&hellip; kinda looks like him, long rabbit ears and soft purple-ish hue. Its forehead fur resembles <span class="pomni">Pomni</span>'s bangs, and it definitely has her blush spots. It's&hellip; <em>adorable.</em></p>

<p class="tadc-narration">The child curls its tiny paw around his finger. He tries to be angry, but his tail betrays him. One wag, then a few more in rapid succession. His expression softens.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Maybe&hellip; it won't be so bad.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> holds out her hands.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>Can I?</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> nods and eases her over. She readjusts the blanket.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>I've got you now. Easy.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> stays close, hands still up, just in case. His tail slows but doesn't stop.</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> holds the child the best she can; she's only ever held cousins and nephews before, and never very long.</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span>, somehow, holds it much more naturally.</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="ragatha">Ragatha</span> leans in.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-ragatha"><b>Ragatha: </b>So, hmm&hellip; what are we naming her?</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> and <span class="jax">Jax</span> exchange an uncertain look.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>We&hellip; don't know yet.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>Well, I could help with that!</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="caine">Caine</span> snaps. The familiar name generator drops down from the ceiling. He lines up a swing on the activation lever.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>No. Absolutely not!</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">She looks down at the child.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>Daisy.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-zooble"><b>Zooble: </b>Daisy? As in Daisy Bell? The song you three belted outside my room to force me out?</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="kinger">Kinger</span> raises a finger.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-kinger"><b>Kinger: </b>First song a computer ever performed. Bell Labs. Historic.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>I&hellip; think I've read about that somewhere.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-kinger"><b>Kinger: </b>Read what somewhere?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-gangle"><b>Gangle: </b>Is that why Caine chose that song? I thought it was a reference to 2001.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>The towers?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-gangle"><b>Gangle: </b>No, <em>Sheesh</em>. The movie!</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>To be fair, I think that's where Kubrick took the idea.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-kinger"><b>Kinger: </b>Something about towers?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Forget it, nutso. It's after your time.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-ragatha"><b>Ragatha: </b>I think it's after mine as well. Did something happen in 2001?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>You&hellip; don't wanna know, Rags.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> readjusts the blanket.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>So, Daisy then?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Sorry toots! Name&rsquo;s already taken. Whole tag full of Daisies. You wouldn't <em>believe</em> who it is, either.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="caine">Caine</span> pulls out a binder from a non-existent pocket. He riffles through the pages.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>Doesn't look like there's any Daisy in my files.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Tell that to the search bar!</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-zooble"><b>Zooble: </b>NO. FOURTH WALL. BULL<del>SHIT</del>. We talked about that.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span>'s voice firms.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>We're keeping Daisy.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-gangle"><b>Gangle: </b>It's cute. It suits her.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> looks at the kid. His ears soften.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Yeah. It fits.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="daisy">Daisy</span> lets out a cute yawn.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Welcome to the circus, Daisy.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-zooble"><b>Zooble: </b>So what's the plan here, Caine? These two get to play parents? That's it, that's the adventure?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>Glad you asked, Zooble! This will be a long-term adventure. I haven't done one of those in&hellip; well, ever.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-bubble"><b>Bubble: </b><small>Except the one time.</small></p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>I usually don't like keeping AIs active for prolonged periods of time. It leads to&hellip; instability. But, fear not, I'll keep a close eye, <em>or several</em>, on the situation.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="caine">Caine</span> snaps his fingers. A pamphlet appears in <span class="jax">Jax</span>'s hand.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Oh great&hellip; homework. <q>So you've been voluntold to be a parent.</q></p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> blinks at the booklet, large pinwheels for pupils.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>There's a manual?</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>A pamphlet. Cheat sheet. It contains all the information you'll need to take proper care of this child.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-gangle"><b>Gangle: </b>You know, new parents back in the real world get one of those, too. It&hellip; doesn't really do a great job preparing you for it.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> unfolds it open.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Feeding schedules, sleep cues, <em>age-acceleration notes</em>&hellip; what?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>Daisy will start as a newborn. She&rsquo;ll age rapidly in order to keep the adventure to a reasonable number of days. Your job is to ensure she's properly cared for.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="ragatha">Ragatha</span> edges closer.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-ragatha"><b>Ragatha: </b>We can help, right?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>Of course! You'll be acting as family and friends to the new parents.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> looks concerned.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>What if we&hellip; can't.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Waa. It'll be fine, Pompom. I basically raised my younger siblings! Besides, I'm sure Caine will be hovering.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>I'll be monitoring with occasional check-ins. Minimal hand-holding.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-bubble"><b>Bubble: </b>It's like we're not even here.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">Pop.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-zooble"><b>Zooble: </b>So this never&hellip; turns off?</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>Not until adolescence. Enough questions!</p>


<p class="tadc-narration">Snap. Multiple boxes appear nearby, all C&amp;A-branded.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-caine"><b>Caine: </b>You've been given a complimentary starter pack. Diapers, bassinet, stroller, everything you need. I'll be providing additional care packages at every milestone.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="caine">Caine</span> disappears in a puff of smoke.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">The crowd disperses.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-ragatha"><b>Ragatha: </b>We'll be nearby if you need us.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-zooble"><b>Zooble: </b>I can assemble the stroller, if you want.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>You think we can't-</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>We do. Thanks, Zooble.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> sighs.</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> gives <span class="zooble">Zooble</span> a small, relieved smile.</p>
<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="zooble">Zooble</span> shrugs, already dragging the box closer.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-zooble"><b>Zooble: </b>If it collapses, it's user error.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="jax">Jax</span> crosses his arms, ears dipping just a little.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>Well, guess that saves me the trouble. Don't mess it up.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration">His tail gives one quick, traitorous wag. <span class="pomni">Pomni</span> turns to him.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>You know, I'm afraid I'll mess up, that I'll do it wrong.</p>
<p class="tadc-dialog-jax"><b>Jax: </b>You will, then you'll get it less wrong.</p>

<p class="tadc-narration"><span class="pomni">Pomni</span> looks down at the child.</p>

<p class="tadc-dialog-pomni"><b>Pomni: </b>I think&hellip; yeah. I&hellip; I can work with that.</p>
